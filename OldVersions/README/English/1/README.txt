# Awesome AI2001

`🧠️🖥️2️⃣️0️⃣️0️⃣️1️⃣️🕶️📜️ The (currently low tier, but official) Awesome List for AI2001.`

## About

This is an Awesome List for open source software created with AI2001 that heavily utilizes the framework. Since the AI2001 API is still very early in development, and there isn't a strong enough public adoption of the framework, this Awesome List will remain empty for a while.

## What is an Awesome list?

[:octocat: `@sindresorhus`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/) defines an [:octocat: `Awesome list as:`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md)

### Only awesome is awesome

> `Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.`

## Notice to core developers

AI2001 repositories that are part of the framework (such as [:octocat: `AI2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001/)) are not to be included in an awesome list, only derivatives created from them are allowed.
